# nrfxlib-sys

This is a Rust wrapper for the Nordic
[nrfxlib](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrfxlib) set of libraries,
primarily `libmodem` and `liboberon` for the nRF91* series chips (System-in-Packages). Supported chips are the following:

* nRF9160
* nRF9151
* nRF9161

Any binary which uses this crate is going to need to provide a bunch of C
library functions, because Nordic's library expects them. This includes, but
is not limited to:

* atoi
* snprintf
* strol
* strchr

You can't just link `newlib`, because that defines `memset` which clashes with
the `compiler-builtin` crate's definition of `memset`. Answers on a post-card
please - for now I'm using
[tinyrlibc](https://github.com/thejpster/tinyrlibc).

## Using

**NOTE**: This crate does **not** follow [semver](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html). The version of this crate tracks the version of the underlying Nordic [libraries](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/tags).

In your own program or library, you can depend on this crate in the usual fashion:

```toml
[dependencies]
# A chip feature must be selected
nrfxlib-sys = { version = "=2.7.1", features = ["nrf9160"] }
```

Because the modem library has its debug sections compressed and Rust's tooling doesn't have support for
that by default, this crate either strips the debug sections or decompresses them.

By default the crate uses the `llvm-tools` that can be installed using `rustup component add llvm-tools`.
In this case the debug sections get stripped.

If you'd rather have the debug sections decompressed, then disable the default features on this crate and
enable the `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` feature. This will try to use the `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` binary that you can
download from the ARM website. This one does have support for debug section compression.

This is a low level wrapper. You might prefer the blocking [higher-level wrapper](https://crates.io/crates/nrfxlib):

```toml
[dependencies]
nrfxlib = "*"
```

You might also prefer the async [higher-level wrapper](https://crates.io/crates/nrf-modem):

```toml
[dependencies]
nrf-modem = "*"
```
